# Method Documentation IntelliJ plugin

![Build](https://github.com/diffitask/JB-method-doc-plugin/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

<!-- Plugin description -->
Method Documentation is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that adds an intention for writing method documentation. Plugin
supports adding documentation for Kotlin and Java. Documentation is generated by artificial
intelligence [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com) (model '
text-davinci-003') based on the method code.

## How does it work?

The plugin analyzes symbols under the cursor in the code opened in the editor. If the cursor is located above the
method name, IntelliJ IDEA proposes to create documentation for this method, if it has not yet been, or replace the
existing one:

If there were any comments related to the method before the function declaration, they are saved intact.

Example of the plugin work:

##### Before

```kotlin
fun awesomeMethod(dayNumber: Int): String {
    return "Awesome day number $dayNumber!"
}
```

##### After

```kotlin
/**
 * Generates an awesome phrase for the specified day number.
 *
 * @param dayNumber The day number.
 * @return An awesome phrase for the specified day number.
 */
fun awesomeMethod(dayNumber: Int): String {
    return "Awesome day number $dayNumber!"
}
```

## Installation and running

### Important! Add your OpenAI API secret key

Before running the plugin, it is necessary to **get your unique OpenAI API secret key**, which can be generated
here: [OpenAI API keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), and then **write it** on the line number 81
in
the ['MethodDocumentationIntentionAction.kt'](https://github.com/diffitask/method-doc-intellij-plugin/src/main/kotlin/com/methoddoc/intention/MethodDocumentationIntentionAction.kt)
file, so that relevant documentation can be created.

Otherwise, the same stub will always be shown as the documentation.

### Running

## Tests

To check the correctness of the plugin in various cases there
are tests for Kotlin and Java code examples. To run the tests,
run ['MethodDocumentationIntentionTest.kt'](https://github.com/diffitask/method-doc-intellij-plugin/src/test/kotlin/com/methoddoc/intention/MethodDocumentationIntentionTest.kt)
class.
